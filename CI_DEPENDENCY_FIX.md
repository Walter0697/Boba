# CI Dependency Fix

## ⚠️ Critical Issue Fixed

**Problem:** The `auto-version.yml` workflow was running independently and could create releases even if CI failed.

**Impact:** Broken code could be released if tests failed.

## ✅ Solution Applied

Updated `auto-version.yml` to wait for CI to complete successfully before running.

### Before (WRONG)
```yaml
name: Auto Version and Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - master

jobs:
  auto-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Runs immediately on push, doesn't wait for CI!
```

**Problem:** Runs as soon as you push, doesn't check if CI passed.

### After (CORRECT)
```yaml
name: Auto Version and Release

on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["CI"]
    types:
      - completed
    branches:
      - main
      - master

jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success'
    # Only runs if CI passed!
  
  auto-release:
    needs: check
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Only runs after check passes
```

**Solution:** Waits for CI workflow to complete and only runs if CI succeeded.

## 🔄 New Flow

### When you push to main:

```
1. Push to main
   ↓
2. CI workflow runs
   ├─ Tests
   ├─ Linting
   └─ Build
   ↓
3. CI completes
   ├─ If SUCCESS → Auto-version workflow triggers ✅
   └─ If FAILURE → Auto-version workflow does NOT run ❌
   ↓
4. Auto-version workflow (only if CI passed)
   ├─ Analyzes commits
   ├─ Determines version
   ├─ Builds binaries
   └─ Creates release
```

## ✅ Benefits

- ✅ **No releases if CI fails** - Tests must pass first
- ✅ **Automatic dependency** - No manual configuration needed
- ✅ **Safe releases** - Only working code gets released
- ✅ **Clear workflow** - Easy to understand the flow

## 📊 Comparison

| Scenario | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Push to main, CI passes | ✅ Release created | ✅ Release created |
| Push to main, CI fails | ❌ Release still created! | ✅ No release (correct!) |
| Push to main, tests fail | ❌ Release still created! | ✅ No release (correct!) |

## 🎯 Current Workflow Configuration

### Active Workflows

1. **CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)**
   - Trigger: Push to main/master
   - Actions: Tests, lint, build
   - Blocks: Auto-version if fails

2. **Auto-Version Workflow (`auto-version.yml`)**
   - Trigger: After CI completes successfully
   - Actions: Version bump, build, release
   - Depends on: CI workflow

### Disabled Workflows

- `release.yml.disabled` - Old release workflow
- `tag-release.yml.disabled` - Manual tag workflow
- `auto-release.yml.disabled` - Semantic-release workflow

## 🔍 Verification

To verify the fix works:

```bash
# 1. Make a change that breaks tests
echo "broken" > test_file.go

# 2. Commit and push
git add test_file.go
git commit -m "feat: test CI dependency"
git push origin main

# 3. Check Actions tab
# - CI should run and fail
# - Auto-version should NOT run
# - No release should be created ✅

# 4. Fix the tests
rm test_file.go
git add test_file.go
git commit -m "fix: remove broken file"
git push origin main

# 5. Check Actions tab
# - CI should run and pass
# - Auto-version should run
# - Release should be created ✅
```

## 📝 Configuration Details

### workflow_run Trigger

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["CI"]  # Name of the CI workflow
    types:
      - completed      # Wait for completion
    branches:
      - main
      - master
```

### Check Job

```yaml
check:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  if: github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success'
  # Only runs if CI succeeded
```

### Auto-Release Job

```yaml
auto-release:
  needs: check  # Depends on check job
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  # Only runs if check job passed
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### CI Workflow Name

The `workflow_run` trigger uses the workflow **name**, not the filename:

```yaml
# In ci.yml
name: "CI"  # ← This name must match

# In auto-version.yml
workflows: ["CI"]  # ← Must match the name above
```

If you rename the CI workflow, update the reference in `auto-version.yml`.

### Workflow Permissions

Both workflows need proper permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write  # Needed to create releases
```

## 🎓 How It Works

### GitHub Actions workflow_run

The `workflow_run` event triggers a workflow after another workflow completes:

1. **CI workflow runs** (triggered by push)
2. **CI workflow completes** (success or failure)
3. **workflow_run event fires** (auto-version workflow triggered)
4. **Check job evaluates** `github.event.workflow_run.conclusion`
5. **If success** → Continue to auto-release job
6. **If failure** → Stop, no release created

### Event Data

The `workflow_run` event provides:
- `github.event.workflow_run.conclusion` - "success" or "failure"
- `github.event.workflow_run.name` - Name of the completed workflow
- `github.event.workflow_run.head_branch` - Branch that triggered it

## ✅ Summary

**Problem:** Auto-version could release broken code
**Solution:** Added CI dependency with `workflow_run`
**Result:** Releases only created if CI passes

**Current flow:**
```
Push → CI runs → CI passes → Auto-version runs → Release created ✅
Push → CI runs → CI fails → Auto-version blocked → No release ✅
```

**No more broken releases!** 🎉

**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Workflow:** `auto-version.yml` updated
**Dependency:** CI must pass before release
