# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Go application that provides an interactive command-line interface for comprehensive development environment setup across different platforms (WSL, Linux, and macOS). The application will present users with a main menu system using arrow keys to navigate between different setup categories including CLI tool installation, environment configuration, AWS profile setup, and secret management. This eliminates the need to manually configure development environments on each new machine.

## Requirements

### Requirement 0

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to authenticate with GitHub to access my private configuration repository, so that I can use my personalized setup configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs to access the private repository THEN the system SHALL prompt for GitHub authentication
2. WHEN prompting for authentication THEN the system SHALL support GitHub personal access token input
3. WHEN a valid token is provided THEN the system SHALL store it securely for the session
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL test access to the specified private repository
5. WHEN the private repository is accessible THEN the system SHALL proceed with the requested operation
6. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry
7. IF the private repository cannot be accessed THEN the system SHALL display a specific error about repository permissions

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to navigate through a main menu using arrow keys, so that I can easily access different setup categories without typing commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a main menu with options: "Install Everything", "List of Available Tools", "Setup Environment", and "Installation Configuration"
2. WHEN the user presses the up arrow key THEN the system SHALL move the selection cursor to the previous menu item
3. WHEN the user presses the down arrow key THEN the system SHALL move the selection cursor to the next menu item
4. WHEN the user reaches the top of the menu and presses up THEN the system SHALL wrap to the bottom of the menu
5. WHEN the user reaches the bottom of the menu and presses down THEN the system SHALL wrap to the top of the menu
6. WHEN a menu item is selected THEN the system SHALL highlight it visually to indicate current selection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access different setup functionalities through menu navigation, so that I can configure my entire development environment from one interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses Enter on "Install Everything" THEN the system SHALL first authenticate with GitHub, then fetch the private repository to read the complete setup configuration
2. WHEN GitHub authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL clone or pull the latest version of the specified private repository
3. WHEN the private repository is accessed THEN the system SHALL read configuration files to determine the full tool list, then apply any local overrides from the Installation Configuration
4. WHEN local overrides exist THEN the system SHALL only install tools that are enabled in the local configuration
5. WHEN no local overrides exist THEN the system SHALL install all tools specified in the GitHub repository configuration
4. WHEN the user presses Enter on "List of Available Tools" THEN the system SHALL authenticate with GitHub and fetch the tool list from the private repository
5. WHEN the user presses Enter on "Setup Environment" THEN the system SHALL navigate to shell configuration options
6. WHEN the user presses Enter on "Installation Configuration" THEN the system SHALL navigate to configuration management options
7. WHEN in any submenu THEN the system SHALL provide a way to return to the previous menu level using 'b' key or Escape

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working across different platforms, I want the installer to work on WSL, Linux, and macOS, so that I can use the same tool regardless of my operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs on Linux THEN the system SHALL use appropriate package managers (apt, yum, pacman, etc.)
2. WHEN the application runs on macOS THEN the system SHALL use Homebrew for installations
3. WHEN the application runs on WSL THEN the system SHALL detect and use the appropriate Linux distribution package manager
4. WHEN the system cannot detect the platform THEN the system SHALL display an error message and exit gracefully
5. IF a package manager is not available THEN the system SHALL provide instructions for manual installation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want access to my personalized list of CLI tools through the "List of Available Tools" menu, so that I can selectively install tools from my private repository configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to "List of Available Tools" THEN the system SHALL authenticate with GitHub and fetch the tool configuration from the private repository
2. WHEN the private repository is accessed THEN the system SHALL parse the tool configuration file to build the available tools list
3. WHEN displaying tools THEN the system SHALL show each tool with its current installation status (installed/not installed) and description from the repository configuration
4. WHEN the user selects a specific tool THEN the system SHALL install that tool using the installation method specified in the repository configuration
5. WHEN a tool installation completes THEN the system SHALL update the display to reflect the new installation status
6. IF the private repository cannot be accessed THEN the system SHALL display an error message and offer to retry authentication
7. IF the tool configuration file is missing or malformed THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the installation status and manage already installed tools, so that I can avoid duplicate installations and maintain my tool setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL check which tools are already installed
2. WHEN displaying the tool list THEN the system SHALL indicate which tools are already installed with a visual marker
3. WHEN a user selects an already installed tool THEN the system SHALL offer options to reinstall or skip
4. WHEN checking installation status THEN the system SHALL verify tool availability in the system PATH
5. IF the system cannot determine installation status THEN the system SHALL assume the tool is not installed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up my shell environment configuration, so that I can have my personalized shell appearance and behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to "Setup Environment" THEN the system SHALL display options for shell configuration setup
2. WHEN the user selects shell configuration THEN the system SHALL first create a backup copy of the existing .zshrc file
3. WHEN the backup is created THEN the system SHALL fetch the custom .zshrc configuration from the private GitHub repository
4. WHEN the custom .zshrc is retrieved THEN the system SHALL apply it to the user's home directory
5. WHEN the .zshrc is applied THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to restart their shell or source the new configuration
6. IF the .zshrc backup fails THEN the system SHALL display an error and abort the configuration process
7. IF the custom .zshrc cannot be retrieved from the repository THEN the system SHALL display an error and offer to retry

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure installation behavior through the "Installation Configuration" menu, so that I can customize which tools get installed locally while still using my GitHub repository as the source.
