## 🚀 How to Use

### Creating a Release

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on main with latest changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create and push a version tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0: Initial release"
git push origin v1.0.0

# 3. GitHub Actions will automatically:
#    - Run all tests
#    - Build binaries for all platforms
#    - Create compressed archives
#    - Generate checksums
#    - Create GitHub release with artifacts and notes
```

### Building Locally

```bash
# Linux/macOS
chmod +x deploy/scripts/build-all.sh
./deploy/scripts/build-all.sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
.\deploy\scripts\build-all.ps1

# Output will be in ./dist/ directory
```

### Testing a Release

```bash
# Download a binary
wget https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/boba/releases/download/v1.0.0/boba-linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Extract
tar -xzf boba-linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Test
./boba-linux-amd64 --version
```
